This archive has three directories.

The directory `chemprop-IR` contains a copy of the GitHub repository used to predict IR spectra and compatible with the trained models stored here. Current versions of this repository can be found at "https://github.com/gfm-collab/chemprop-IR". This repository can be used in conjunction with the trained models to predict IR spectra.

The directory `computed_IR_spectrum_generation` contains the software and instructions used to create new computed spectra. Note, these spectra are used only for model pretraining and are not reliable spectrum predictions.

The directory `trained_ir_model` contains the trained chemprop-IR model files that can be used for predictions and other files used in training models. Within this directory, the file `recommended_config.json` contains the arguments used with chemprop-IR to train these models. The directory `computed_model` contains the computed spectra generated for training the initial spectrum model (`computed_spectra.csv`), data splits used in computed model training, and individual model files for each trained submodel used to predict computed spectra. The directory `experiment_model` contains an example of the phase order used in the corresponding model (`example_of_phase_feature_order.csv`), the spectral mask file used to specify spectrum exclusion regions for certain phases (`spectral_mask.csv`), the SMILES and phase features used in each data split (train/val/test) in model training, and the individual model files for each trained submodel used to predict experimental spectra.

To make predictions of experimental spectra with the trained models, use `predict.py` within the chemprop-IR repository according to the instructions in the repository's readme file. Use the path to `trained_ir_model/experiment_model` as your specified checkpoint_dir. As directed in the repository's readme, also supply the path to your test_data file (desired prediction SMILES), path to your features file (properly ordered phase features for prediction), and the path for prediction output.
